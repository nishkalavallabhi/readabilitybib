	depends upon combining cortical patterns evoked by grammatically
	related elements; but in long sentences the pattern evoked by one
	element may have decayed before the next related element is read.
	Long words may cause difficulty because they are generally the more
	precise words, requiring longer to categorise semantically; but the
	longer the search for a word's meaning, the more likely that the
	preceding context will be lost beyond recall.},

	evaluated by applying each metric to language samples obtained from
	30 different adult speakers, aged 60-90 years. The analysis then
	determined how well each metric indexed age-group differences in
	complexity. In addition, individual differences in the complexity
	of adults' language were examined as a function of these complexity
	metrics using structural equation modeling techniques. In a follow-up
	study, judges listened to sentences in noise, rated their comprehensibility,
	and attempted to recall each sentence verbatim. Hierarchical multiple
	regression was used to evaluate the structural equation model, derived
	from the language samples, with respect to sentence comprehensibility
	and recall. While most of the metrics provided an adequate account
	of age-group and individual differences in complexity, the amount
	of embedding and the type of embedding proved to predict how easily
	sentences are understood and how accurately they are recalled. },

	proficiency in the target language. Based on a synthesis of twenty-five
	studies, I arrive at several substantive findings. First, I conclude
	that the relationship between L2 proficiency and L2 writing syntactic
	complexity varied systematically across studies depending on whether
	a second or a foreign language learning context was investigated
	and whether proficiency was defined by programme level or by holistic
	rating. Second, aggregating available cross-sectional findings, I
	propose critical magnitudes for between-proficiency differences in
	syntactic complexity for four measures. Finally, I interpret the
	limited longitudinal evidence to suggest that an observation period
	of roughly a year of college-level instruction is probably needed
	for substantial changes in the syntactic complexity of L2 writing
	to be observed. I conclude the paper by discussing implications of
	these findings for future primary research.},

	data from the CHILDES database (MacWhinney 2000). Experiment results
	show that the model achieves an accuracy of 94.0\% and 93.2\% on

  abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to examine the validity of the
	approach to lexical diversity assessment known as the measure of
	textual lexical diversity (MTLD). The index for this approach is
	calculated as the mean length of word strings that maintain a criterion
	level of lexical variation. To validate the MTLD approach, we compared
	it against the performances of the primary competing indices in the
	field, which include vocd-D, TTR, Maas, Yule's K, and an HD-D index
	derived directly from the hypergeometric distribution function. The
	comparisons involved assessments of convergent validity, divergent
	validity, internal validity, and incremental validity. The results
	of our assessments of these indices across two separate corpora suggest
	three major findings. First, MTLD performs well with respect to all
	four types of validity and is, in fact, the only index not found
	to vary as a function of text length. Second, HD-D is a viable alternative
	to the vocd-D standard. And third, three of the indices MTLD, vocd-D
	(or HD-D), and Maas appear to capture unique lexical information.
	We conclude by advising researchers to consider using MTLD, vocd-D
	(or HD-D), and Maas in their studies, rather than any single index,
	noting that lexical diversity can be assessed in many ways and each
	approach may be informative as to the construct under investigation.},

	they make it possible to retrieve web pages on a topic specified

	does not take into account which of the search results are comprehensible
	for a given user an issue of particular relevance when considering
	students in an educational setting. And current search engines do
	not support teachers in searching for language properties relevant
	for selecting texts appropriate for language students at different
	stages in the second language acquisition process. At the same time,
	raising language awareness is a major focus in second language acquisition
	research and foreign language teaching practice, and research since
	the 20s has tried to identify indicators predicting which texts are
	comprehensible for readers at a particular level of ability. For
	example, the military has been interested in ensuring that workers
	at a given level of education can understand the manuals they need
	to read in order to perform their job. We present a new search engine
	approach which makes it possible for teachers to search for texts
	both in terms of contents and in terms of their reading difficulty
	and other language properties. The implemented prototype builds on
	state-of-theart information retrieval technology and exemplifies
	how a range of readability measures can be integrated in a modular

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we examine current practices in the measurement of syntactic complexity to illustrate the need for more organic and sustainable practices in the measurement of complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF) in second language production. Through in-depth review of examples drawn from research on instructed second language acquisition, we identify and discuss challenges to the evidentiary logic that underlies current approaches. We also illuminate critical mismatches between the interpretations that researchers want to make and the complexity measures that they use to make them. Building from the case of complexity, we point to related concerns with impoverished operationalizations of multidimensional CAF constructs and the lack of attention to CAF as a dynamic and interrelated set of constantly changing subsystems. In conclusion, we offer suggestions for addressing these challenges, and we call for much closer articulation between theory and measurement as well as more central roles for multidimensionality and dynamicity in future CAF research.},
