	evaluated by applying each metric to language samples obtained from
	30 different adult speakers, aged 60-90 years. The analysis then
	determined how well each metric indexed age-group differences in
	complexity. In addition, individual differences in the complexity
	of adults' language were examined as a function of these complexity
	metrics using structural equation modeling techniques. In a follow-up
	study, judges listened to sentences in noise, rated their comprehensibility,
	and attempted to recall each sentence verbatim. Hierarchical multiple
	regression was used to evaluate the structural equation model, derived
	from the language samples, with respect to sentence comprehensibility
	and recall. While most of the metrics provided an adequate account
	of age-group and individual differences in complexity, the amount
	of embedding and the type of embedding proved to predict how easily
	sentences are understood and how accurately they are recalled. },

	scale (Rosenberg &#38; Abbeduto 1987; Covington et al. 2006). The
	system takes a raw sentence as input and assigns it to an appropriate
	developmental level on the scale. The system is designed with child
	language acquisition and psycholinguistic research in mind, and is
	therefore developed and evaluated using both written data from the
	Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. 1993) and spoken child language acquisition
	data from the CHILDES database (MacWhinney 2000). Experiment results
	show that the model achieves an accuracy of 94.0\% and 93.2\% on
	unseen test data from the Penn Treebank and the CHILDES database
	respectively. We illustrate how the system is used in an example
	application to investigate the correlation of average D-Level score
	and speaker age.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to examine the validity of the
	approach to lexical diversity assessment known as the measure of
	textual lexical diversity (MTLD). The index for this approach is
	calculated as the mean length of word strings that maintain a criterion
	level of lexical variation. To validate the MTLD approach, we compared
	it against the performances of the primary competing indices in the
	field, which include vocd-D, TTR, Maas, Yule's K, and an HD-D index
	derived directly from the hypergeometric distribution function. The
	comparisons involved assessments of convergent validity, divergent
	validity, internal validity, and incremental validity. The results
	of our assessments of these indices across two separate corpora suggest
	three major findings. First, MTLD performs well with respect to all
	four types of validity and is, in fact, the only index not found
	to vary as a function of text length. Second, HD-D is a viable alternative
	to the vocd-D standard. And third, three of the indices MTLD, vocd-D
	(or HD-D), and Maas appear to capture unique lexical information.
	We conclude by advising researchers to consider using MTLD, vocd-D
	(or HD-D), and Maas in their studies, rather than any single index,
	noting that lexical diversity can be assessed in many ways and each
	approach may be informative as to the construct under investigation.},

	Long words may cause difficulty because they are generally the more

	mismatches between the interpretations that researchers want to make

	from the case of complexity, we point to related concerns with impoverished
	operationalizations of multidimensional CAF constructs and the lack
	of attention to CAF as a dynamic and interrelated set of constantly
	changing subsystems. In conclusion, we offer suggestions for addressing
	these challenges, and we call for much closer articulation between
	theory and measurement as well as more central roles for multidimensionality
	and dynamicity in future CAF research.},

	that the relationship between L2 proficiency and L2 writing syntactic
	complexity varied systematically across studies depending on whether
	a second or a foreign language learning context was investigated
	and whether proficiency was defined by programme level or by holistic
	rating. Second, aggregating available cross-sectional findings, I
	propose critical magnitudes for between-proficiency differences in
	syntactic complexity for four measures. Finally, I interpret the
	limited longitudinal evidence to suggest that an observation period
	of roughly a year of college-level instruction is probably needed
	for substantial changes in the syntactic complexity of L2 writing
	to be observed. I conclude the paper by discussing implications of
	these findings for future primary research.},

	does not take into account which of the search results are comprehensible

	raising language awareness is a major focus in second language acquisition
	research and foreign language teaching practice, and research since
