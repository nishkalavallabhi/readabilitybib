# readabilitybib
An unannotated bibliography on Automatic assessment of readability of a given text. I am starting with what I have in my PhD thesis, and what I collected over the past 4-5 years of working on this topic. Everyone is free to add to this. If anyone is interested in joining and collaborating, please send me a message with your github id.
